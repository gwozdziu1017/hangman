Hangman project is another project opened by me to practice C++ development skills.
Hopefully this project will be finished.

Created by: gwozdziu
Start date: 04.01.2022

Purpose of the project: Hangman game
Description:
At the beginning user can choose how many people will play the game (up to 4 players)

Single game mode:
User will play by himself.
Game needs to import randomly choosen word from words database and then player needs to guess the word.
	minimum requirement: Failure counter - program counts up to 7 mistakes taken by user (may be less because I think maybe 7 is too much)
	second proposition: Lives counter - at the beggining user can se 7 lives and each mistake will reduce number of lives by 1
	best approach     : classical hangman is being draw each time user fails
After winnig or loosing user is informed on the screen

Multiplayer mode:
User needs to select how many palyers will play.
Each player nedds to fill "name" field.
Word is imported like in single player mode.
Players take turn in order to guess given word.
Failure counter is the same as in singleplayer mode.

Choosen word is seen like "_ _ _ _ " and every guessed letter is show as many times as it occurs in the word.

Classes and their purpose:
GameHanlder.h - class that is responsible for handling whole gameplay
WordHandler.h - word handling means drawing word from database and checking given letters and fulfilling the word.
Player.h - class responsible for player handling - name, no of fails etc
Menu.h - menu handling
